		<p>my friend I decided to document the different agriculture careers we came into contact with as we traveled and stayed in californa for a week.
		we felt that if we could take some of the people along with their ideas and experiences in the agriculture industry and then put them on a website it would be a greate way of sharing what we learned from them.
		we recently read the book fourty chances and we were curious  the people who work in the agriculture industry and who contibute to feedinng the world.
		we decided taht as we met people we would get pictures and then we would interview them and find out why they chose the job they did and how they got there.
		we also wanted to know how they feel they are making an impact on the world.</p>

		<a id="border"><p>When you think about the border you might think drugs, weapons and immigrants but there is more to that. You always need to hear both sides of the coin and learn about it. Border patrols taught us how a day a day work is at the frontier. There's risks like any other job but if it wasn't for them our country would be a dangerous place. They are our first line of defense.</p></a>

		<a id="animal"><p>We went to the San Diego and spent all morining at the zoo learning all the different animals. There were so many animals and so much diversity that it was to believe that we were still at earth. Animals from all over the world were there some in risk of extintion. It's interesting to learn the background of each animal and think outside the box.</p></a>
		<p> We also visited a cow feed lot and a sheep feeding operation and learned about the role animals play in feeding us. We also got to see horses and learned about how horses played a large role in agriculture when we visited a museum.</p>

		<a id="food"> <p>We visited several farms as well as a reaserch center and we found out that people are always finding more efficient ways to grow food. They are also trying to find ways to grow food year round and to make the food safer to consume.</p></a>

		 <section height="100%">
		
		<a id="date"><p>the last place we visited was a large date farm with over 8,000 date trees. these trees al came from 12 trees taht were saved from a plague that was killing them off in morraco. its amazing that they were able to be brought over to the united states so that they could continue to grow and we did not lose all of that fruit.</p></a>
